                        Each player starts with 5 cards in their hand, which is the maximum number of cards you can have in your hand at one time. You can play multiple cards at a time, as long as you have enough recourse points (located at the bottom of the screen.

                        <br></br>
                        Each character card has a resource cost, attack power, and defense power:

                        <p>
                        There are 3 playable slots in the ATTACK  ROW, and 2 playable slots in the defense row. The Attack Row may attack the opponentâ€™s Attack Row or their Defensive Row. However, the Defensive Row may not attack.  
                        When ready to play a card simply drag and drop the card of your choice into the respective slot that you want (if for some reason the card does not drop into the specified slot, it is not your turn or you cannot play that card in that position). 
                        <br></br>
                        Damage to the cards will be dealt automatically. Any card that reaches 0 health, will be removed from the play area, and set to the players graveyard.   
                        <br></br>
                        At the beginning of your turn you gain 1 Resource. You are allowed to play as many cards you can per turn, but not required to.  
                        When you are done with your turn, press the End Turn button at the top of the screen.  When your turn ends, you will gain 1 Resource.
